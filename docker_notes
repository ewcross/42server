COPY - to add files and directories to container's filesystem

ADD - does same thing but has more added functionality - like pulling files from urls or extracting compressed files

ENV - sets environment variables in the container environment
ENV - also sets var value at that point in dockerfile, so they can be used in subsequent lines

RUN - executes commands
	  either 'RUN <command>' - shell form or RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] - exec form
	  should run apt-get update and install together "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install <packages>"
	  to avoid caching issues

VOLUME - used to store stuff in given directory on host filesystem to preserve after container is stopped
		 or deleted - good for things that users of apps will edit permanently

USER - specifies user

WORKDIR - specifies working directory - can be changed multiple times throughout dockerfile
		- created if doesn't already exist

EXPOSE - inform users which ports application is litening on
	   - does not make those ports accessible to the host

CMD - specify the command to run when the container itself is run
	- any arguments in the 'docker run' command override this command

ENTRYPOINT - specify the comman to run when the container itself is run
		   - any arguments in the 'docker run' command are appended to the end of this command
